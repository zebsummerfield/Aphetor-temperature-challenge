# Aphetor-temperature-project
Aphetor was the company that hosted 'The Creator Games', a large collaboration between many social media creators which pitted them against each other in a series of challenges. I was hired as a freelance engineer to program a selection of ESP32 microcontrollers which would collect body temperature data during a cold water challenge, and send it to an api to be shown during streams in real-time as well as being displayed on an OLED screen.
