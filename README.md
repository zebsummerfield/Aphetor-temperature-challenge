# Aphetor-temperature-project
Aphetor was the company that hosted 'The Creator Games', a large collaboration between many social media creators which pitted them against each other in a series of challenges.

In this project several ESP32 microcontrollers are programmed to collect body temperature data for a cold water challenge, and send them to an api to be shown during streams in real-time as well as on a local screen.
